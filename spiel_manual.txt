I have extensive experience with Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data analysis.

I excelled in all aspects of CU’s Economics program’s analysis projects, from data gathering, munging, and analysis to actionable decisions and presentations. While working at AlsoEnergy I created a report analysis, validation, and submittal tool that decreased our reporting process from a week to a few hours, mitigated poor customer relations, and prevented possible litigation. I then went to Galvanize’s Data Science program to further develop my analytic toolkit; this program has improved my ability to analyze data and automate processes. My experience with analysis, data, and leadership combined with my passion for learning, business improvement, and problem-solving make me a perfect fit for your position.

I would love to discuss what I can bring further, please call me at 804-387-2413 or email me at maxwell.caudle@gmail.com.

Thanks,
Max
